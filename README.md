# ANFIS

Implementation of a basic version of [Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/256541) and analysis of its performance on [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

To run it yourself, first download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), standardize each feature and then use [`main.py`](main.py).
